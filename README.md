# Semi-Unsupervised-Lifelong-Learning-for-Sentiment
Lifelong machine learning is a novel machine learning paradigm which continually learns tasks and accumulates knowledge for reusing. The knowledge extracting and reusing abilities enable the lifelong machine learning to understand the knowledge for solving a task and obtain the ability to solve the related problems. In sentiment classification, traditional approaches like Na√Øve Bayes focus on the probability for each words with positive or negative sentiment. However, the lifelong machine learning in this paper will investigate this problem in a different angle and attempt to discover which words determine the sentiment of a review. We will pay all attention to obtain knowledge during learning for future learning rather than just solve a current task.
